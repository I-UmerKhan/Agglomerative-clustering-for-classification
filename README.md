# ML-model-agglomerative-clustering-for-classification
I learned how to use agglomerative clustering for classification. This hierarchical clustering method is useful because it groups similar data points into clusters based on their distance, starting with individual points and merging them iteratively. Agglomerative clustering helps in identifying natural groupings within the data, which can be valuable for exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and creating meaningful subgroups for further classification tasks. It is particularly useful when the underlying structure of the data is unknown, as it provides insights into the data distribution and relationships between different data points.
